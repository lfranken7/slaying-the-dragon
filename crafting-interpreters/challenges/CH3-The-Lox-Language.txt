Question 3:
    Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations of Lox in my repository). Try to come up with edge case behavior I didn’t specify here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?
  - TODO: Make a Lox program that breaks things
    This informal introduction leaves a lot unspecified. List several open questions you have about the language’s syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers should be?
  - TODO: Find some Syntax and Semantic holes in the explaination 
    Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)
  - TODO: Find what sucks about Lox that makes it unusable
